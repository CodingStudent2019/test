 # 1) UX:

## USER STORIES:

- *As a customer, I want to find the best package/rates for my next trip.*

- *As a traveller, I want a diverse and an easy shopping experience to find my next holiday destination.*

## (a) SCOPE:

- *We understand that each traveller is different from another and will have several different requirements to fulfil throughout their journey to ensure that they have the best holiday possible.*

- *I wish to allow customers to choose a package that is suitable for their unique requirements and also provide travellers with the choice of selecting individual services offered by the company to make their journey an unforgettable one.*

## (b) SURFACE:

- *I have created this website using one of the latest [color schemes](/assets/images/palette.pdf "coolors.com - The super fast color schemes generator"), keeping it simple, yet in line with the latest designing trends.*

## (c) STRATEGY:

- *My aim is to make the website easy to navigate, self-explanatory, visually appealing and provide a smooth shopping experience to site navigators with different preferences and requirements.*

## (d) STRUCTURE:

- *The search functions provided within my website allow site navigators to gain access to the various different services provided by the company to meet their individual requirements.*

- *I have provided site navigators with access to information about the following resources via the Google Maps APIs, closer to their chosen destination:*

**(1) Hotels**

**(2) Restaurants**

**(3) Local Tourist Attractions**

**(4) Search for nearby places around any city in the world.**

- *The site navigators can then look at markers highlighting the search results on the map provided within this website.*

## (e) SKELETON:

- *The design for this website is depicted in the wire-frames attached below to demonstrate how it is supposed to display on small, medium and large screen sizes:*

*(i) [SMALL-SCREENS-WIRE-FRAME](/assets/wireframes/small-screens-wireframe-GLOBECONNECTIONS.pdf "wireframe for small-sized screens")*

*(ii) [MEDIUM-SCREENS-WIRE-FRAME](/assets/wireframes/medium-screens-wireframe-GLOBECONNECTIONS.pdf "wireframe for medium-sized screens")*

*(iii) [LARGE-SCREENS-WIRE-FRAME](/assets/wireframes/large-screens-wireframe-GLOBECONNECTIONS.pdf "wireframe for large-sized screens")*

- *The live website is slightly different from the one depicted in the wire-frames because some features and styles were amended whilst enhancing the website.*

 # 2) FEATURES:

## Existing Features:

- **The active/functional features in this website are as follows:**

*(1) The Google Maps Search functionality, which allows site navigators to enter a destination of their choice to find information about accommodation, restaurants and local tourist attractions around those places.*

*(2) Information about popular destinations chosen by site users.*

## Features Left to Implement (in the future):

- **In the future, I would like to implement the following features to my website:**

*(1) Login/Sign-up*

*(2) Access to booking systems for flights, hotels, restaurants and local tourist attractions.*

*(3) The choice of accessing and choosing from different packages to provide an extensive shopping experience.*

*(4) Access to additional resources such as the latest news/updates from the travel industry, health, beauty, safety tips and other useful external resources.*

------------
------------

 # 3) TECHNOLOGIES USED:

- *The technologies used in the creation of this website are as follows:*

*(1) [BOOTSTRAP](https://getbootstrap.com/ "Build responsive, mobile-first projects on the web with the world’s most popular front-end component library")*

*(2) HTML*

*(3) CSS*

*(4) JAVASCRIPT*

*(5) [JQUERY](https://jquery.com/ "jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library. Whether you're building highly interactive web applications or you just need to add a date picker to a form control, jQuery UI is the perfect choice")*

*(6) [GOOGLE MAPS](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation "the Google Maps Platform for developers")*

------------
------------

# 4) TESTING:

- *The customer and traveller user stories have been achieved by creating a website that is straight-forward to use and provides easy access to the various services offered by the company in a clear, concise and a professional manner.*

- *All sections provide users with various options which they can choose from and the site navigators also have access to additional useful information, which is a very essential part of any customer's/traveller's journey.*

- *The site navigators can click on any images for them to then open in a new tab/window (by adding **target="_blank" rel="noopener"**).* 

- *The map also opens in a new tab/window (because of adding **target="_blank" rel="noopener"**) when a site navigator clicks on the name of the place provided within the info-windows on the map.*

- #### *Form testing (modal button trigger form in the footer):*

| - *I have added the *"required"* attribute to test all the input fields of the modal registration form in the footer, namely "**First name**", "**Last name**", "**Email**" and "**Password**".* |
| ------------ |
| - *The form throws an error (For e.g.: Please fill in this field), when any of the input fields are left blank or if an invalid email address is entered.  The site navigator will not be able to submit the form as a result.* |
| - *If all the fields are completed correctly on the form when it is submitted, the page will reload without performing any other actions.*  |

- *The website responsiveness and broken-link tests were thoroughly conducted using the following parameters/resources:*

*(1) [RESPONSIVE-TEST-TOOL](http://responsivetesttool.com/ "testing the responsiveness of the website")*
